-- What CoE5SE gives a mod's Lua script, written for your editor. CoE5SE never runs this file: it runs
-- only <ModName>.lua, <ModName>_commands.lua, and the files they require. Copy it next to your
-- script, and VS Code or Cursor with the Lua extension (LuaLS) completes coe5.* as you type and shows
-- these notes on hover.
--
-- How a script runs: CoE5SE loads it on the first main menu frame, after every DLL has started,
-- and runs its top-level code once. Only an enabled mod's files ever run. A mod that adds mod
-- commands keeps its coe5.addModCommand calls and their handlers in <ModName>_commands.lua, which
-- loads first, in the same Lua state, before the startup mod pass reads a line; <ModName>.lua sees
-- what it defines, and require("<ModName>_commands") returns what it returned. If the commands file
-- stops with an error, <ModName>.lua never loads. The two files exist only so the commands are
-- added before the game reads any mod's content. A later CoE5SE may load <ModName>.lua early too,
-- right after the commands file, so write neither to depend on when the other loads. Of the coe5
-- functions, a commands file may call only coe5.addModCommand and coe5.log while it loads; any
-- other coe5 call returns nil (lua_refused reason=commands_file), while require, print, warn, and
-- Lua's libraries work as usual. It has Lua's base library (without load, dofile, loadfile, and
-- collectgarbage, and with CoE5SE's own require, below), string, table, math, utf8, and coroutine;
-- there is no io, os, or package, and its only files are the ones it requires from its own mod's
-- folder and its own data files (coe5.readIni and the rest). print and warn
-- write lua_print and lua_warning lines to coe5mod.log, as coe5.log does; coe5.log's and print's
-- lines only while the player has CoE5SE's script_log setting on (off by default). One call into
-- the script may run 20,000,000 Lua steps, counting the coroutines it resumes, its __gc
-- finalizers, and library loops (table.move, concat, unpack, sort, insert, remove, and string
-- find, match, gmatch, gsub: one step per element, byte, or match step), and 10,000 steps for each
-- coe5.route call (about 2,000 routes in one call). The count starts again
-- when the game draws a frame (coe5.ui.wait, a next() that ran one, or a call that comes after
-- one, even inside the script's own wrap). A call that spends it stops
-- the script for good: pcall, a __close handler, or a new coroutine can't catch the stop, and
-- xpcall's handler doesn't run for it (lua_refused reason=step_limit). A script's Lua state may
-- hold 1.5 GB, and all scripts' together 6 GB: past the first the script gets "not enough memory"
-- and is stopped the same way (memory_cap); past the second the script holding the most is
-- (memory_total). A coe5 call made outside a
-- call into the script (a __gc finalizer while CoE5SE closes a stopped script) returns nil
-- (reason=not_running).

-- When CoE5SE refuses a call, the call returns false or coe5.message.notAdded (each note below

--
-- A wrong argument type, an unknown name, a read-only value, or a call that runs too long is an
-- error instead: logged as lua_error, it stops the script until the game restarts. Its functions
-- don't run again, and its wraps pass the game's calls straight on (a wrap that errors gives the
-- game what next returned). A call of the script still running further out (a wrap waiting in
-- next) finishes, but adds no wrap, observer, or callback (lua_refused reason=script_stopped), and
-- CoE5SE turns setupAutomated off if the script left it on. Put a risky part in pcall to keep the script running (the step limit
-- is the one error pcall can't catch). An error names
-- the place as <ModName>.lua:<line> (or a required file's gatherer/safety.lua:<line>), never the
-- file's full path.

-- No table fills up: any number of mods can add buttons, Game Menu lines, and wraps.

---Runs `<name>.lua` from your mod's own folder, the one holding <ModName>.lua, and returns what it
---returns (true when it returns nothing). Each dot is a subfolder: require("gatherer.safety") runs
---gatherer/safety.lua. A file runs once, in your script's Lua state (its globals, step budget, and
---memory), and gets its name as `...`; a later require of the same name returns the first one's
---value. It works at load time and later. A name is 1 to 200 bytes of letters, digits, and _, a
---single dot between folders, in the case the files are stored in (on Windows too). Refused, with
---lua_refused call=require and an error to the caller: any other name (empty_name, name_too_long,
---bad_character, bad_name, reserved_name for a Windows device name such as con), a file or folder
---in another case (wrong_case), a link or junction on the way (link), and your own <ModName>
---(main_script). A missing file and a loop (a file that requires itself through others) are errors
---too, and a file of bytecode doesn't load. There is no package table.

---The game calls a script can run code around with coe5.wrap. Each note gives the function you

---a wrap go onto the game's own screen. A site marked "Windows only" isn't found on the Mac build
---yet: coe5.wrap returns false there.
---@alias coe5.Site
---| "MAIN_MENU_WAIT"            # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the main menu. next returns the clicked id (coe5.mainMenu).
---| "MAIN_MENU_PLAY_GAME"       # fn(next, server): Start New Game or Load Game (server 0 in single player). next returns after the Game Over screen, or at once if the player cancels setup. Not called when the player backs out of a loaded save whose spells changed.
---| "PLAY_GAME_NEW_WORLD"       # fn(next, mode): a new game's setup and world. Mode coe5.newGame.normal, .network, or .skipParticipants. next returns 0 on Cancel. Not called for a loaded game.
---| "NEW_WORLD_MAP_SCREEN"      # fn(next): Random Map Settings. next returns coe5.newGame.mapScreenOk on Ok, 0 on Cancel.
---| "NEW_WORLD_INIT_PARTICIPANTS"  # fn(next, arg): the default single-player slots, set before Setup Participants draws; after next returns, the slot values are what the screen opens with. Pass arg on unchanged. next returns nothing.
---| "NEW_WORLD_CREATING_WORLD"  # fn(next, kind, text): "Creating World", before the classes are rolled. next(kind, text) shows the text; other text is shown as it is (a % in it isn't read as a format). next returns nothing.
---| "MAP_SETTINGS_WAIT"         # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of Random Map Settings. next returns the clicked id; coe5.newGame.mapSettingsOk is Ok.
---| "PARTICIPANTS_WAIT"         # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of Setup Participants. next returns the clicked id; coe5.newGame.participantsOk is Ok.
---| "PARTICIPANTS_DIFFICULTY_WAIT"  # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of Setup Participants' AI difficulty popup. next returns the clicked id. "newWorldUniqueRandom" is nil here (the popup is a call of its own).
---| "PARTICIPANTS_BUTTON_ROW"   # fn(next, style): starts Setup Participants' Ok row. Lines drawn before next go above the row; lines drawn after it go into the row, above Ok. next returns an integer. On Mac CoE5SE makes the row itself (the game has no call for it there), and next works the same.
---| "GAME_MENU_SAVING_SECTION_END"  # fn(next): closes the Game Menu's "Saving & Exiting" section. Lines drawn before next go at the end of the section. next returns an integer.
---| "GAME_MENU_WAIT"            # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the in-game Game Menu (F10). next returns the clicked id; coe5.gameMenu.resign resigns. CoE5SE's own wrapper, which runs the Game Menu lines, runs first.
---| "RITUAL_SCREEN_ROW"         # fn(next, id, a, b, name, costType1, cost1, costType2, cost2, costType3, cost3, costType4, cost4, hover, apCost, castable, mirrorMonster, mirrorText): one row of the ritual screen. id is the slot + coe5.ritual.rowCastable, or + coe5.ritual.rowGreyed when greyed out; hover is the reason text, and the costs are already scaled for the caster; pass a and b on unchanged. hover and mirrorText may be nil; name may not. In next, a mirrorMonster past the last monster or a costType above 50 is refused (lua_refused reason=out_of_range) and the game's own value kept. next returns nothing the game uses (nil).
---| "MAP_SCREEN_WAIT"           # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the map screen, after the game has bound its shortcuts. next returns the clicked id; coe5.mapAction.gameMenu opens the Game Menu. A commander's button is 20000 + its index (negated too); an id for a commander past the game's last becomes 0 (lua_refused, reason=commander_past_table). After next, "mapPointerX" and "mapPointerY" hold the square under the pointer and "mouseButtons" the frame's buttons (set it to 0 to keep a click from the map). A line drawn here isn't shown: the map lays out its lines before this wait.
---| "MAP_MENU_BUTTON_TEXT"      # fn(next, text): the map's "(F10) Menu" button text. next(text) draws it; pass other text to draw that. next returns nothing the game uses (nil).
---| "SQUARE_INFO_SCREEN"        # fn(next, player, x, y, mode): the square info window, "(i) terrain info", for square (x, y). In next, a player that isn't a slot (0-31) is refused (lua_refused reason=out_of_range) and the game's own kept. next returns nothing the game uses (nil).
---| "SQUARE_INFO_BUTTON_ROW"    # fn(next, style): starts the square info window's Ok row. Lines drawn before next go above the row. next returns an integer. On Mac CoE5SE makes the row itself (the game has no call for it there), and next works the same.
---| "SQUARE_INFO_WAIT"          # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the square info window. next returns the clicked id; the window uses coe5.screen.squareInfoOk and 2.
---| "LOAD_GAME_BROWSER"         # fn(next, title): Load Game's save list (the game's file browser, which other screens use too). next returns 1 when a save was picked, 0 on Cancel. The browser's other arguments go on unchanged.
---| "FILE_BROWSER_ROW_DATE"     # fn(next, id, text): one row's date column in the file browser. Row n's id is coe5.screen.fileBrowserRowFirst + n; the row is 450 wide. next(id, text) draws it; draw more after it with coe5.ui.columnX and coe5.ui.text. next returns an integer.
---| "FILE_BROWSER_WAIT"         # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the file browser. Returning coe5.screen.fileBrowserDelete deletes the row the "hoveredId" value names (the browser reads it right after the wait), after the game's own question. A row id past the browser's last listed row becomes 0, no click (lua_refused, reason=row_past_list or hovered_row_past_list).
---| "FILE_BROWSER_HOVERED"      # Windows only until CoE5 5.41, which inlined it as Mac always had: on neither build now, so coe5.wrap returns false. The browser reads "hoveredId" right after its wait; set it in a FILE_BROWSER_WAIT wrap to pick the row to delete.
---| "MOD_BANNER_DRAW"           # fn(next, path, x, y, w, h, alpha): one enabled mod's banner in the column on the right of the menu screens. x is the screen width - 210, y the screen height - 60 - 60 * row, w 200. Skip next to hide the banner. Pass path to next as it came: another path is refused (lua_refused reason=path_changed) and the game's own banner drawn. next returns nothing.
---| "GAME_OVER_WAIT"            # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the Game Over screen. The game passes coe5.gameOverMode.fog (fog and falling particles; mode 8 draws them too); any other mode clears to black, and coe5.gameOverMode.plain draws nothing behind the screen. next returns the clicked id.
---| "ARMY_WAIT"                 # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of Transfer troops. next returns the clicked id.

---| "MAP_EDITOR_WAIT"           # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the map editor. next returns the clicked id (coe5.mapEditor, or a coe5.addMapEditorLine id). A key bound with coe5.ui.bindKey before next counts for that frame, toolbox hidden or not.
---| "MAP_EDITOR"                # fn(next): the whole map editor, opened from the Mods screen's Start Map Editor or the --mapeditor launch option; next returns when the player quits it. With --mapeditor the editor opens before the main menu: the scripts load just before it, and the game exits when it closes.
---| "MAP_EDITOR_DRAW"           # fn(next): once per frame of the map editor's map, after the map's squares and before the toolbox, the plane buttons, and the hover box. Draw with coe5.ui.drawLine, drawText and drawRect: before next lands over the map and under the toolbox, after next over everything but the hover box. coe5.mapView says where each square is. next returns nothing.
---| "MAP_DRAW"                  # fn(next): once per frame of the world map in a player's turn, after the squares and the units and before the top bar, the commander panel, and the hover box. Draw with coe5.ui.drawLine, drawText and drawRect: before next lands over the map and under the game's panels, after next over everything but the hover box. coe5.mapView says where each square is. next returns nothing. Windows only for now: on Mac coe5.wrap returns false.
---| "MESSAGES_WAIT"             # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the Messages screen, as a human turn starts (View messages shares it). next returns the clicked id; return coe5.box.messagesOk to close it, as the player's Ok does.
---| "WARN_WAIT"                 # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the game's warning box ("<name> has been eliminated" and the like). next returns the clicked id; return coe5.box.warnOk to press its Ok.
---| "MESSAGE_BOX_WAIT"          # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the game's message box (the End Turn Warning, and any question the game asks with one or two buttons). next returns the clicked id, 0 for none; return coe5.box.firstButton, secondButton or cancel to answer it as the player would. Its text reads as messageBoxText meanwhile. Windows only for now: on Mac coe5.wrap returns false.
---| "TOP_BAR_INCOME"            # fn(next, player, resource, income): the "+income" the map's top bar draws after one of the player's resources (0 Gold to 13 Lifeforce, as slotResource; not the gems or the trade points). Return the number to draw; next returns the game's. Only the drawn number changes: the income the game pays, which the AI reads, stays the game's. Windows only for now: on Mac coe5.wrap returns false.
---| "BATTLE_EDITOR_WAIT"        # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the battle map editor. next returns the clicked id.

---| "UNIT_LIST_WAIT"            # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of a battle's unit list (F1). next returns the clicked id. A unit's row is 100000 + its unit index (negated too); an id for a unit past the game's last becomes 0 (lua_refused, reason=unit_past_table).
---| "KEYBOARD_SHORTCUTS_WAIT"   # fn(next, block, mode): each frame of the Keyboard Shortcuts screen. next returns the clicked id.
---| "TOOLTIP_LINE_DRAW"         # fn(next, text, index, r, g, b, alpha): one line of the hover text box at the bottom of the screen, on every frame it shows. text is the line as the game cut the hover text to the box's width, index its place (0 the top line; the game draws them from the last up), and r, g, b, alpha its colour, 0 to 1 (the game's white, 1 1 1 1). next(text, index, r, g, b, alpha) draws it in the colour you pass. Pass text and index as they came: other ones are refused (lua_refused reason=text_changed or index_changed) and the line's own kept. next returns nothing.
---| "AI_EXPLORE"                # fn(next, commander, comstr): an AI player's exploration target for one commander, during its moves; comstr is the commander's strength. next(commander, comstr) returns the game's choice: score, x, y (x and y coe5.aiMove.noSquare for none). Return score, x, y to send the commander to any square of the world, on any plane (the game routes it, through portals too); return score alone to keep next's square; return nothing to keep next's choice. The game runs this only while the commander's earlier steps (rally, friendly move, conquest) scored below coe5.aiMove.exploreBelow, and keeps the square only when the score is above their best (commanderAiMoveKind is coe5.aiMove.target when one of them picked a square, at commanderAiTargetX and Y); a score of coe5.aiMove.farExploreBelow or more also skips the game's far exploration. A square off the world or on no plane, a score above 0 with no square, or values that aren't whole numbers are refused (lua_refused reason=off_map, no_plane, no_square, not_a_score, not_a_square, out_of_range) and next's choice kept; another commander in next is refused (commander_changed). Not in network games.
---| "AI_RALLY"                  # fn(next, commander, comstr): the AI's rally step for one commander, the first of its steps: a square of the player's where its other commanders' armies could join this one. Takes and returns what AI_EXPLORE does, with the same refusals; the game keeps the square when the score is above 0, and the move is then coe5.aiMove.target.
---| "AI_FRIENDLY_MOVE"          # fn(next, commander, comstr): the AI's move to a square a teammate owns, after AI_RALLY; the game drops a square where an enemy army near it is much stronger than comstr. Kept when the score is above the rally's; as AI_RALLY otherwise.
---| "AI_CONQUER"                # fn(next, commander, comstr): the AI's conquest step, after AI_FRIENDLY_MOVE: a square to attack or take, among those the player has seen; -999 for none. Kept when the score is above the earlier steps' best; as AI_RALLY otherwise.
---| "AI_FAR_EXPLORE"            # fn(next, commander, comstr): the AI's far exploration, after AI_EXPLORE, run only while the best score is below coe5.aiMove.farExploreBelow: an unseen square anywhere. Kept when the score is above the best, and the move is then coe5.aiMove.explore. As AI_RALLY otherwise.
---| "AI_RITUAL_CANDIDATE"       # fn(next, commander, ritual): one candidate of the AI's ritual plan choice for a commander with no plan (commanderRitualPlan 0), after the game's income, "rare", "never plan this" and other data reasons passed it. next(commander, ritual) runs the game's pointless check of it (the corpses and resources the ritual needs at the caster's square) and returns true when the ritual isn't pointless, false when it is. Return false to veto the candidate (the game drops it as "pointless" and draws the next); return true or nothing to keep it, which leaves the decision to the game: a kept candidate always gets next's answer, called for you if the wrap didn't, so a wrap can veto but never plan what the game drops. A kept candidate is not yet planned: after the wrap the game still checks it is not bad for the AI, can be cast, has the ritual's terrain seen near enough, and meets its time and location rules, and drops it if any fails. Another value is refused (lua_refused reason=not_a_boolean) and keeps; another commander or ritual in next is refused (commander_changed, ritual_changed). A wrap that errors keeps. coe5.scrapRitualPlan works inside it. Not in network games.
---| "AI_RECRUIT"               # fn(next, player): an AI player's recruiting step, once a turn after AI_TURN and before its commanders move. next(player) runs the game's own buying: from the player's offers (coe5.shopOffers) at its citadels, keeping gold for the game's save target (10 turns of gold income, at most 250). Skip next and the game buys nothing this turn. coe5.aiBuyOffer buys inside it, before or after next. next returns nothing. Not in network games.
---| "AI_GATHER_TROOPS"         # fn(next, commander): the AI's troop pick-up for one commander, before each of its move steps: next(commander) takes the free troops on its square that may join it, leaving a share there (20% on a citadel, 60% with under 2 citadels), or, with none free, leaves some of its own ranged troops behind. Don't call next to skip it: the commander takes and leaves nothing this step, and the troops stay free for another commander there. Another commander in next is refused (commander_changed). A wrap that errors runs it. coe5.scrapRitualPlan works inside it. Not in network games.
---| "AI_PICK_UP_LONER"          # fn(next, commander, unit): the AI's pick-up of one lone commander (unit is its unit) into the army of commander, a caster of a higher ritual level on its square, after the game's checks passed it: from then on the lone commander and its followers follow commander and never move on their own again. next(commander, unit) joins them and returns how many units joined; don't call it (return 0) to keep the lone commander free. Another commander or unit in next is refused (commander_changed, unit_changed). A wrap that errors runs it. coe5.scrapRitualPlan works inside it. Not in network games.
---| "AI_SPLIT_ARMY"             # fn(next, commander, minUnits): the AI's split of a commander's army, at the end of its routine before its moves, in 25% of the calls: with minUnits units or more following it (the game's own is 240), the best commander that follows it leaves with some of its troops (each troop of strength up to 100 to 299 with a 10% chance, in two passes, until the larger of a fifth and 40 to 99 units went). minUnits is the game's minimum for this call; next(commander, minUnits) runs the split with the minimum given, 1 or more, for this call only (lua_refused reason=out_of_range keeps the game's). Don't call next to skip it. No commander follows another unless the AI picked it up (AI_PICK_UP_LONER), so with none nothing splits. Another commander in next is refused (commander_changed). A wrap that errors runs it. coe5.scrapRitualPlan works inside it. Not in network games.
---| "AI_MOVE_COMSTR"            # fn(next, commander): the strength the AI commander's route takes for one move step, right after AI_GATHER_TROOPS and before the game routes it to the square its steps kept. next(commander) returns the game's own, the strength of the commander's army. The route won't end on a square whose army is stronger than the strength allows (times 100, divided by aiAttackDivOther, aiAttackDivAi or aiAttackDivHuman by that army's owner, less 15, aiAttackMargin's value), so return a larger one, such as several commanders' strength together, to let it route onto a stronger army; the square itself was picked by the steps. Returns a whole number from -1 to 21474836, as coe5.route's comstr; another value is refused (lua_refused reason=not_a_number or out_of_range) and next's kept. Return nothing for next's. Another commander in next is refused (commander_changed). coe5.route works inside it. A wrap that errors gives the game's. Not in network games.
---| "CEREMONY_PERFORM"          # fn(next, ceremony, commander, target): one of the Voice of El's ceremonies, a player's (the Ceremonies screen, a map order) or the AI's. ceremony is the game's number for it: match it by coe5.get("ceremonyName", ceremony), never by the number. target is the player a Start Crusade goes against, -1 for every other ceremony. next(ceremony, commander, target) is the game's own: it checks the rank, limits and cost (and does nothing when one fails), charges the cost and action points, and does the ceremony. Skip next and none of it happens: no cost, no action points, no effect, and no message. Code after next adds effects of your own. Another ceremony, commander or target in next is refused (ceremony_changed, commander_changed, target_changed) and the game's kept. A wrap that errors runs it. Not in network games.
---| "CEREMONY_COSTS"            # fn(next, commander): the game works out every ceremony's cost for a priest of El: at the top of the Ceremonies screen, before a map order's ceremony, and before the AI's. After next(commander), coe5.get("ceremonyCost", ceremony) holds each one and coe5.set("ceremonyCost", ceremony, value) changes it: the screen shows that cost, the ceremony checks and charges it, and the AI weighs it, until the next time the game works them out. The game multiplies some: Break Seal's by the seal's number (1 for the first), Bolster Devotion's by one more than the player's earlier Bolster Devotions, Increase Divine Favor's by the level it raises the favor to, Convert Settlement's by a fifth of the square's gold income (its action points too). Each is gold, or relics for Break Seal, Bolster Devotion and Increase Divine Favor. Another commander in next is refused (commander_changed). Not in network games.
---| "SEAL_BREAK"                # fn(next, slot, seal): one of the Seven Seals breaking, by a player's Break Seal ceremony or an item, slot that player; seal is the seal it breaks, 1 to 7. Inside the wrap the seals broken are still seal - 1; next(slot, seal) breaks it, as the game does. Skip next and the seal stays unbroken, so none of what follows from it happens (its event, SEAL_EVENT; El's minions for the Voice of El players get no stronger), and the next Break Seal ceremony breaks the same seal again. The ceremony's cost and action points are spent either way. To break the seal but replace its event, wrap SEAL_EVENT instead. The seals the game breaks on its own at a month's end ("Cardinal Intervenes", "Heavenly Surge of Power") don't come here. Another slot or seal in next is refused (slot_changed, seal_changed). A wrap that errors breaks it. Not in network games.
---| "SEAL_EVENT"                # fn(next, slot, seal): a broken seal's event, at a month's end: the month after it broke, one seal a month in order when several broke, whoever broke it (a ceremony, an item, or the game at a month's end), once per seal. seal is 1 to 7; the game's events: none for the first two, an Apocalyptic Rider for the third to the sixth ("The apocalypse is coming closer"), the Apocalypse for the seventh. slot is always -1: the game keeps no record of who broke a seal. next(slot, seal) lets the game run its event, which it does once every wrap has returned (so code after next runs before the event); next returns nothing. Skip next to replace the event with your own: the seal stays broken, its event counts as done and never comes back, and the next seal can be broken as before. What the wrap returns isn't read. Another slot or seal in next is refused (slot_changed, seal_changed). A wrap that errors runs it. Not in network games.

Negative for what it pays (the gold of a buy, the resource of a sell, the trade points), positive for what it gets. Read with the stocks of now plus those incomes; the step's own random draw can give one unit more or less, and the more likely is taken; type 23's gem is that draw's, so no gem is listed. 0 with no trade type.
